Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on Titanic Dataset

🚢 Titanic Survival Analysis

📌 Project Overview : 

This project performs Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset to identify key factors influencing passenger survival.

The analysis focuses on understanding how demographic and socio-economic features impacted survival outcomes.

🎯 Objective : 

Perform data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a dataset of your choice, such as the Titanic dataset from Kaggle. 

Explore the relationships between variables and identify patterns and trends in the data.

📊 Key Visualizations : 

✔ Survival Count Distribution

✔ Age vs Survival Analysis

✔ Fare Distribution

✔ Passenger Class vs Survival

✔ Correlation Matrix Heatmap

🔍 Key Insights : 

• Survival was not random

• Higher passenger class had higher survival probability

• Higher fare passengers were more likely to survive

• Women and children had better survival rates

• Strong relationship between Fare and Passenger Class

🛠 Tools & Technologies Used : 

Python

Pandas

NumPy

Matplotlib

Seaborn

Jupyter Notebook

📈 Exploratory Steps : 

Data Cleaning

Handling Missing Values

Distribution Analysis

Relationship Analysis
